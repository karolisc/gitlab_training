Submitting feature proposals  
Asking questions  
Reporting bugs and malfunction  
Obtaining support  
Elaborating new code implementations

---

#### add labels

- status
- category

Note:

easy way to categorize the issues or MR

---

#### organize Our work

- assignee - one owner and only one per issue
- add Due-date
- add estimate time

1. want feedback? - create a merge request
1. assign or mention the person you would like to review
1. add [Draft] to the title if itâ€™s a work in progress
1. when accepting, always delete the branch
1. anyone can comment, not just the assignee
1. push corrections to the same branch

Note:

Merge requests steps  
Create your first merge request:

Use the blue button in the activity feed  
View the diff (changes) and leave a comment  
Push a new commit to the same branch  
Review the changes again and notice the update.

#### Merge conflicts

- two people at the same time are modifying
  same file in similar area
- merge conflicts are annoying
- can feel complicated
- happen all the time
- need to fix conflicts one by one

#### Feedback and Collaboration

- MR are a time for feedback and collaboration
- giving feedback is hard
- be as kind as possible
- empower approval system
- receiving feedback is hard
- be as receptive as possible
- feedback is about the best work, not the person
  You are not your work

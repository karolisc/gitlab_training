### Workflow
---

#### create an Issue

- always start from an Issue
- one-to-one link to issues

Note:

It's most useful for:

Discussing ideas  
Submitting feature proposals  
Asking questions  
Reporting bugs and malfunction  
Obtaining support  
Elaborating new code implementations

---

#### add labels

- easy way to categorize the issues or MR
- priority
- status

---

#### organize Our work

- assignee - one owner and only one per issue
- interested in an issue?
  - add to to-do list
  - subscribe
- add Due-date
- add estimate time
- group issues together - Milestones
- create boards
- use tempates (issue, MR)

Note:

avoid task lists

#### Merge requests (MR)

1. When you want feedback create a merge request.  
   Target is the ‘master’ branch.
1. Assign or mention the person you would like to review.
1. Add [Draft] to the title if it’s a work in progress.
1. When accepting, always delete the branch.
1. Anyone can comment, not just the assignee.
1. Push corrections to the same branch.

Note:

Merge requests steps  
Create your first merge request:

Use the blue button in the activity feed.  
View the diff (changes) and leave a comment.  
Push a new commit to the same branch.  
Review the changes again and notice the update.

#### Merge conflicts

- two people at the same time are modifying
  same file in similar area
- merge conflicts are annoying
- can feel complicated
- Happen all the time
- Need to fix conflicts one by one

- Giving feedback is hard.
- Be as kind as possible.
- Receiving feedback is hard.
- Be as receptive as possible.
- Feedback is about the best work, not the person. You are not your work

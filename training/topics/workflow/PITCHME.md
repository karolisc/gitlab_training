#### Merge requests (MR)

When you want feedback create a merge request.  
Target is the ‘default’ branch (usually master).  
Assign or mention the person you would like to review.  
Add [Draft] to the title if it’s a work in progress.  
When accepting, always delete the branch.  
Anyone can comment, not just the assignee.  
Push corrections to the same branch.

Merge requests steps  
Create your first merge request:

Use the blue button in the activity feed.  
View the diff (changes) and leave a comment.  
Push a new commit to the same branch.  
Review the changes again and notice the update.

#### Feedback and Collaboration

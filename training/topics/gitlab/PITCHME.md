Merge requests (MR)
When you want feedback create a merge request.
Target is the ‘default’ branch (usually master).
Assign or mention the person you would like to review.
Add [Draft] to the title if it’s a work in progress.
When accepting, always delete the branch.
Anyone can comment, not just the assignee.
Push corrections to the same branch.

---

Merge requests steps
Create your first merge request:

Use the blue button in the activity feed.
View the diff (changes) and leave a comment.
Push a new commit to the same branch.
Review the changes again and notice the update.

Merge conflicts
two people at the same time are modifying same file in similar area
merge conflicts are annoying
can feel complicated
Happen all the time
Need to fix conflicts one by one

Feedback and Collaboration

Giving feedback is hard.
Be as kind as possible.

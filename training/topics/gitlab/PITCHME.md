Merge requests (MR)
When you want feedback create a merge request.
Target is the ‘default’ branch (usually master).
Assign or mention the person you would like to review.
Add [Draft] to the title if it’s a work in progress.
When accepting, always delete the branch.
Anyone can comment, not just the assignee.
Push corrections to the same branch.

---

Merge requests steps
Create your first merge request:

Use the blue button in the activity feed.
View the diff (changes) and leave a comment.
Push a new commit to the same branch.
Review the changes again and notice the update.

Happen all the time

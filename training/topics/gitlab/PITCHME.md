### Gitlab Workflow

---

#### create an Issue

- always start from an Issue
- one-to-one link to issues

Note:

It's most useful for:

Discussing ideas  
Submitting feature proposals  
Asking questions  
Reporting bugs and malfunction  
Obtaining support  
Elaborating new code implementations

---

#### add labels

- priority
- status
- category

Note:

easy way to categorize the issues or MR

---

#### organize Our work

- assignee - one owner and only one per issue
- add Due-date
- add estimate time
- group issues together - Milestones
- create boards
- use tempates (issue, MR)
- interested in an issue?
  - add it to Your to-do list
  - subscribe

Note:

avoid task lists

---

#### Merge requests (MR)

1. want feedback? - create a MR
2. assign or mention reviewer
3. work in progress? - add [Draft]
4. when accepting, always delete the branch
5. anyone can comment
6. push corrections to the same branch

Note:

Merge requests steps  
Create your first merge request:

Use the blue button in the activity feed  
View the diff (changes) and leave a comment  
Push a new commit to the same branch  
Review the changes again and notice the update.

---

#### Merge conflicts

- two people at the same time are modifying
  same file in similar area
- merge conflicts are annoying
- can feel complicated
- happen all the time
- need to fix conflicts one by one

---

#### Feedback and Collaboration

- MR are a time for feedback and collaboration
- giving feedback is hard
- be as kind as possible
- empower approval system
- receiving feedback is hard
- be as receptive as possible
- feedback is about the best work, not the person
  You are not your work

---

#### work review

- view diff (text, img)
- add comments
- approve
